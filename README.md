# Rose Hack 2020 - Hacker Resources
Welcome to Rose Hack 2020! Here we've compiled some helptul guides and tutorials that you might find useful this weekend. If you have any further questions about anything here, you can request help from mentors from Slack. Happy hacking!

## :computer: terminal
The terminal on your computer is one of the most powerful resources you have when building a project. Terminal setups can be different for different operating systems; Once you get yours up and running you'll be pushing pixels in no time.
### MacOS
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
  * an IDE (integrated development environment) created by Apple with a large variety of programming language support
  * an all-in-one package with a text editor, compiler, and build system
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  * a package manager for macOS and Linux
  * allows you to easily install packages you might want to use that macOS or Linux didn't already come with
### Windows
* [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
    * a Linux subsystem for your Windows machine
    * Don't forget to enable Windows Subsystems: (https://developerinsider.co/stepwise-guide-to-enable-windows-10-subsystem-for-linux/)
    * Tip: the Ubuntu bash should have access to your Windows-based disks under `/mnt`. You can add a `cd` statement to your sybsystem's .bashrc (you can open yours in vim by entering `vim ~/.bashrc`, and add yours to the bottom).
      * Example: `cd /mnt/c/Users/janin/Documents`
